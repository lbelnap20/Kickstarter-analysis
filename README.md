# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Examine data on Kickstarter theater campaigns in order to provide client insights on successful theater campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### For the Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I created a pivot table in Excel using campaigns that were categorized under “theater.” I looked only at campaigns between 2009 and 2017 with results of successful, failed, or canceled, and looked at the number of each per month. 	![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88058739/127843380-917fc227-022e-42de-b6da-61afce6d035b.png)

### For the Outcomes Based on Goals, I created a chart that looked at all campaigns with the subcategory of “plays” between 2009 and 2017. I looked at goals ranging from less than $1,000 to more than $50,000 in $5,000 increments and tracked the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled for each amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

Through most of the year, the rate of successful vs failed campaigns show a similar trend, with a large spike of successful campaigns occurring in May, and a gradual climb of failed campaigns during the same period. During the month of December, the rate of successful campaigns drops while the rate of failed campaigns show a slight increase. It seems that more successful campaigns tend to be launched in May, and that campaigns launched in December have a higher chance of failure. However, because the two outcomes mirror each other so closely, it suggests that there are other reasons theater campaigns fail or succeed outside the time of year it is launched.  

Most of successful campaigns have a goal of $5,000 or less, with larger goals showing a sharp decline. There appears to be a spike of successful campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $45,000, but the data set on that range is much smaller than the others, so it may be skewed.

Limitations of this dataset are the years we are analyzing, with the most current campaigns being four years old. We could include data up to 2020 and have a larger data set to pull from and that could provide more data for the Outcomes Based on Goals. 

It is interesting to note that out of the “Theater” category, there are no plays that got canceled. That suggests that even the ones that failed still had contributions. It may be useful to see how close the failed play campaigns came to their goal, and how long the campaigns ran for successful vs failed play campaigns. There could be a correlation between successful campaigns and the length of the campaign.
